# Productivity Tips for Creators



In this article, I list my top tips for creative people to stay productive.

It’s not about hours
--------------------

Clocking in more hours doesn’t mean you’re productive.

There’s a clue in the word, PRODUCTivity. If you’re not making something, you’re not being productive, you’re just being busy.

Beware of “busy”
----------------

Being busy, as already mentioned, is not being productive.

Turn off notifications
----------------------

This one is huge. Turn it off. Nearly everything doesn’t need your immediate attention, it can wait.

Step away from your desk
------------------------

Again, sitting at your computer all day doesn’t mean you’re being productive.

If you’re not making anything, step away, go for a walk, go and think and come back with something to actually do.

The harder you work, the harder you need to rest
------------------------------------------------

Makes sense, right? Recovery is a thing.

Get off social media
--------------------

Again, get off social media. You won’t miss anything.
