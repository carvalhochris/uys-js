# Why artists should focus more on Bandcamp than Spotify



In this article, I share my favourite reasons why artists like you should channel their efforts into your [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) presence more than on Spotify and other streaming platforms.

Shared audience
---------------

When someone follows you on Bandcamp, they get emails about your updates.

Not only that, Bandcamp gives you access to the names and emails addresses of those who do.

Direct marketing
----------------

As with the above reason, because Bandcamp [shares emails with you](https://bandcamp.com/guide), you can then import them into your email marketing software and continue to [nurture and monetise that audience](https://unlockyoursound.com/email-marketing-music/).

Better deal
-----------

When someone buys your music on Bandcamp, you get [nearly all of that](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007902213-How-do-I-get-paid-on-Bandcamp-and-how-often-).

Whereas on Spotify you make penny fractions per stream.

Real music fans
---------------

The people who go on Bandcamp are **active** music fans as opposed to just **passive** music consumers.

They are worth way more.

They spend money on music, buy tickets, and brag to their friends about their collections.

Storefront
----------

On Bandcamp, you can set up a [storefront](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007802594-How-do-I-sell-merch-on-Bandcamp-), list inventory, vinyl, merch, CDs, and anything else you might want to sell to your audience.

Branding
--------

On Bandcamp, you have a good handful of [customisation options](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007802194-Bandcamp-design-tutorial) to make your Bandcamp your own.

Where to start
--------------

By no means do I mean you should ignore streaming altogether.

It’s just where you spend your marketing efforts.

I often advise artists to launch a Bandcamp pre-order [ahead of streaming release](https://unlockyoursound.com/bandcamp-first/).

This way, you can use your Bandcamp profile as a landing page to collect emails and offer more value.
