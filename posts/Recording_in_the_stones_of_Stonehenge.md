# Recording in the stones of Stonehenge



I get a call.

It’s my good friend Daniel.

He says it’s a location recording gig.

At Stonehenge.

In the stones of Stonehenge.

Obviously it was a yes.

The event was Stonehenge 100.

Fast forward to the big day.

It pours it down.

So everyone from every broadcaster there ran underneath a big canopy.

There was a cake in the form of the stones.

There was tea.

The client was The London Sinfonietta for English Heritage.

And it was raining.
