# Derivative Works Explained



***Ever wondered what a derivative work is in music?***

This article serves to help you fully grasp this copyright concept.

What is a derivative work?
--------------------------

Simply, a derivative work is one that has been derived from another.

Here are some examples of derivative works sourced from [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf).

* A motion picture based on a play or novel
* A translation of an novel written in English into another language
* A revision of a previously published book
* A sculpture based on a drawing
* A drawing based on a photograph
* A lithograph based on a painting
* A drama about John Doe based on the letters and journal entries of John Doe
* A musical arrangement of a preexisting musical work
* A new version of an existing computer program
* An adaptation of a dramatic work
* A revision of a website

Who owns the rights to a derivative work?
-----------------------------------------

As per [copyright law](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf), the owner of the original work has exclusive right to create derivatives, meaning they must authorise any other party’s derivative of their work.

> Copyright law vests the original work’s copyright owner with the exclusive right to prepare derivative works. Therefore, the owner in the preexisting work must authorize the creation of a derivative work in order for it to be separately owned by another.

* Language translations

Are cover songs derivative works?
---------------------------------

The difference is subtle, but quite well defined.

A cover song is a song you didn’t write, nor did you make any significant alterations to the work.

A derivative takes material from another song to create a new composition.
