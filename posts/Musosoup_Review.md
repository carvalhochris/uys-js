# Musosoup Review



Musosoup is the only music pr platform I wish I could spend more money on.

Because there I pay for what I get.

In contrast to [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/), my money only goes to those who say “yes” to my submission.

It also features a handy system for building a press kit for those who haven’t got one sorted professionally.

In my experience, all the curators there are communicative and fair.

When someone does take your submission, they make an offer for free or paid coverage, then a dialogue opens between the two of you.
