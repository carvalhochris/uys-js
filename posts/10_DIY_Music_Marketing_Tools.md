# 10 DIY Music Marketing Tools



In this article, I share with you my favourite tools to do marketing the DIY way.

Canva
-----

By far one of my favourite tools ever.

I use it for YouTube thumbnails, presentations, PDFs, artwork, and much more.

It allows me to create high-quality graphics for free with no skills.

Get [Canva](https://partner.canva.com/c/2667852/619765/10068).

OBS
---

Open source streaming tool for anyone looking to live stream from their computer.

Great for artists looking to stream high-quality audio and video from home.

Learn more on the [OBS website](https://obsproject.com/).

Camo
----

Camo is a free app that allows you to use your smartphone as a webcam. Which makes it great for live streams, tutorials, or talking head videos.

Get [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/).

Screenflow
----------

The ultimate app for recording your screen. You can also capture your webcam / camera, and post-produce it all very easily inside the same app.

Mailchimp
---------

If you haven’t heard me bang on about email marketing, you can read about it [here](https://unlockyoursound.com/artists-build-email-lists/).

TL;DR: Email marketing is essential for connecting directly with your audience and promoting products and releases.

Not only is Bandcamp a cool platform for indie artists, but it also serves as a marketing tool as well!

You can set up pre-orders, list merch, and offer more value to your fans.

Hemingway Editor
----------------

This free tool will help you write better marketing copy for your posts, emails, and profiles.

Songwhip
--------

This tool [creates smart links](https://songwhip.com/christianprior) for your releases in seconds with no sign up required.

It’s easily the quickest music link aggregator I have ever tried.

You simply paste your Spotify link and it does the rest.
