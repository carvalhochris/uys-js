# Bandcamp launches ticketed live-streaming service



We love Bandcamp at Unlock Your Sound.

They’re a platform that’s actually designed for artists.

We love that they have been running their [Bandcamp Fridays](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser) and that they actually share their audience with the artists there.

> When the pandemic eliminated a major source of musicians’ income, we immediately began working on ways to help the artists and labels on Bandcamp, without whom we would not exist.

The relationship between artist and Bandcamp is truly a partnership, as opposed to one entity exploiting the works of it’s creators.

Now they have launched [this service](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-ticketed-livestream?fbclid=IwAR1REsEM0PkTVYQbgQbBmHHL3mExzheywpWQgCn5HLDu8WQd7WS8iutQnqU&utm_source=Unlock%2BYour%2BSound&utm_campaign=fac1479991-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_19_02_31&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b34f34b5a8-fac1479991-186888577&mc_cid=fac1479991&mc_eid=e93a2a6d91), a great way for artists to get back into live performance but in a way in which they get remunerated for it.

Happy live-streaming!
