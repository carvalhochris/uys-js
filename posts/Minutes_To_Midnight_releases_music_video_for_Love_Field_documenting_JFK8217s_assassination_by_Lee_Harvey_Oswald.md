# Minutes To Midnight releases music video for Love Field, documenting JFK&#8217;s assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald


> The video takes us through the arrival of JFK and his wife Jackie in Dallas before his infamous demise. Through a variety of black and white and colour video clips we see the joy, celebration and devastation created by one event as JFK is shot. ~ [Indie Buddie](http://www.indiebuddie.com/minutes-to-midnight-love-field-video-premiere/?fbclid=IwAR2parCwlaSJAKtBWcHE3lmRpNSSwjHCJcBrQ6hPgedmGgLVeSXP8yiOHNM)

Read the album Synopsis: <https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/>

Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it’s time to tell the tale of how a young man managed to escape Germany in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round in 1991, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.

**Artist Bio**

After extensive experience working with other artists, arranging, co-writing, and mixing, **Minutes To Midnight** has decided to tell a very personal story of his in the medium of a concept album.


“After 1989 – A Trip To Freedom” is the debut solo album. A thoroughly crafted concept, it’s the result of a personal journey through a painful family legacy during World War II, and the tumultuous decades that followed.
