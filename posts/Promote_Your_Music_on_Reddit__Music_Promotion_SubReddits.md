# Promote Your Music on Reddit | Music Promotion SubReddits



Reddit is the “front page of the internet”.

A great community where people tell stories, share content, and discuss all manner of things.

Reddit is also home to a strong culture of independent music lovers, but you have to be mindful when going in there to promote your own stuff.

The key is to find the right subreddits (Reddit groups) for you and your music, otherwise, you’ll come off as spammy and instantly get downvoted.

Below I have listed some music-centred Reddit communities where independent artists like you can share music.

Make sure you read the rules and guidelines for every community that you intend to post to.
