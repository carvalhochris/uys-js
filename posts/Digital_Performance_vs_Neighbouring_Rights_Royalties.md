# Digital Performance vs Neighbouring Rights Royalties



***Did you know that the US does not recognise neighbouring rights?***

This means that royalties are NOT paid to recording rightsholders when their track is spun in a public setting.

Royalties are paid for the underlying composition of course, which are licenced and [collected by PROs](https://unlockyoursound.com/music-royalties/#performance-royalties).

However, there might still be money left on the table recording side.

Digital Performance Royalties
-----------------------------

Non-interactive streaming platforms pay royalties to master rights-holders via SoundExchange. These are known as **digital performance royalties**.

> SoundExchange administers the statutory license, which allows services to stream artistic content while paying a fixed rate for each play. SoundExchange collects and distributes royalties for the featured artist and the sound recording copyright owner when content is played on a non-interactive digital source.

The Difference
--------------

Neighbouring rights refer to rights-holders when their recording is played publicly, but digital performance refers to their rights when the recording is streamed on a non-interactive streaming platform.
