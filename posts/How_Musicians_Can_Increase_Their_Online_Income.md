# How Musicians Can Increase Their Online Income



*This is a collaborative post and may contain affiliate links*

You don’t need us to tell you that it’s not easy to make money as a musician these days. Music venues are closing down, the rising cost of living has ensured that musicians can’t live in cultural hotspots, and the [streaming platforms](https://unlockyoursound.com/licensing-music-streaming) are paying penny fractions per stream.

If you want to make money, then you’ll need to do it your own way. Happily, there are plenty of ways that musicians can use their website (and other channels) to increase their revenue. While the below ideas won’t make you rich, if you put them all together, then you might find that you can significantly increase your monthly income.

**Sell Innovative Merchandise**
-------------------------------

Selling merchandise has long been a smart way for musicians to earn a side income. Alas, unless you already have a loyal following, then it’s unlikely that people are going to buy a t-shirt with your band’s logo on the front. However, if you can offer innovative merchandise that’s all-around cool, and isn’t just related to your band, then even people who have only vaguely heard of you might make a purchase. For example, what about a cool wine opener or other home essentials that people might like? Slap on your band’s logo, and its merchandise — just not the usual kind.

**Sell Your Music On Your Website**
-----------------------------------

There are plenty of places you can sell your music. But there’s none better than on your website. Why? Because that’ll allow you to earn as high a percentage as possible from the sale. You can use your social media accounts to encourage fans to buy your music through your website, rather than streaming it or buying from another website. There’s software designed for selling music online, as well as for processing payments [in wordpress](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/card-not-present/woocommerce-plugin). There’ll still be some people who prefer to stream your music, but you’ll find that, given the option, there are people who are willing to support you.

**Sell Music Tuition**
----------------------

If you know how to play an instrument, then you’ll have a skill that other people wish to possess. So, why not make some money — and help people’s dreams come true — by selling music tuition through your website? There are a couple of ways to do this. You can put together [courses](https://www.thinkific.com/blog/10-steps-creating-successful-online-course/), by which people can simply buy the course and follow along at their own pace. You can also offer one-on-one lessons via video call. The best approach is to offer both, so people can choose.

If the course becomes a hit, then it might provide you with passive income for years to come.

**Sell Related Products**
-------------------------

If you have a website that’s attracting plenty of monthly visitors, then why not begin selling related products? You might prefer if people buy your music, but hey, any profit is welcome in an era when making money through music is more difficult than ever before. For example, if you’re a guitarist, then you could sell guitars, cleaning instruments, accessories, and other products that people need. If you can vouch for the products, then people will be interested.
