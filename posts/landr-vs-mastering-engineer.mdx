# LANDR vs Real-Life Mastering Engineer — What&#8217;s the difference?



[LANDR](https://imp.i122908.net/c/2667852/1031938/11341) is an automated mastering tool.

A [mastering engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_engineer) is a real person.

Both will give you master files.

And you might like either of them, or even both!

But there are some distinct differences especially in the service being provided.

A major difference is the fact that you can talk to a mastering engineer.

Whereas [LANDR](https://imp.i122908.net/c/2667852/1031938/11341) is just a tool.

LANDR can definitely be an affordable and very quick alternative to using a human.

But a human can have empathy, listen to your feedback and vision, and work with you to the desired outcome.

LANDR is a little more “you get what you’re given”

But for many that’s enough, especially if it’s just for demos or Soundcloud uploads.

[This video](https://youtu.be/n0Cnn0nUGAw) from Will Borza does a great job of explaining the difference using a photography analogy.

And [this video](https://youtu.be/6xSd1pln3iI) from Graham Cochrane of [The Recording Revolution](https://www.recordingrevolution.com/) is a shootout between [LANDR](https://imp.i122908.net/c/2667852/1031938/11341) and pro mastering engineer [Ian Shepherd](https://transactions.sendowl.com/stores/3959/35521).
