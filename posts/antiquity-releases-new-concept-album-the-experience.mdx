This album is the accumulation of thirty years of the existence of Antiquity as a group. Gerald Duchene (Primary writer and producer) explains:

*“…that it is an evolution that got us here, an evolution of songwriting. Music, and the industry it revolves around has changed faster than a lot of musicians could keep up to. Not just in style but how it is consumed, created and dispersed. There is not often a group of musicians siting around a dark rehearsal room any longer. Groups of songwriters can be oceans apart now and just as adept at working with one another which is how Antiquity has evolved into its current stable of musicians. It’s still about the songwriting with more input from group members. More influences, greater variety and more eclectic songs. Groups that lack variety, lack staying power and become stagnant. We have tried to maintain somewhat of a style but it’s hard to control a rushing river. We’ve allowed the songwriting to take us where it will, like a ship on the tide. We decided not to tailor songs for public consumption but to just write and play from the heart. I purposely had the singer come up with his own melody lines so he could make the song his own. I intentionally put the bass player in a position to be creative and come up with base lines that weren’t just rhythmic but creative that helped lead the songs. This album has all the building blocks that propels the music and the listener alike.”*

Gerald Duchene: Songwriter, Producer, and Founding Member



Antiquity was formed in the early nineties primarily as a live act in the New York area. Over the years, it transformed into a studio project centred around songwriting and musical skills, drawing from a cadre of professional musicians and singers. The philosophy has always been, the right musician and singer for the right song. Another part of the philosophy has been to mold the song around the singer, letting the singer develop the melody.

“*We believe that helps the singer make the song their own. Music is perhaps the art that presents the most philosophical questions. We take songwriting as a craft, not making beats but the objective and subjective quality in music. No one is the owner of all truth in this world, but good music, like cream finds its way to the top and we hope our music finds it’s way to your heart.” ~ Gerald Duchene*
