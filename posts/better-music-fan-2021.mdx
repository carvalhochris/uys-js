# How to be a better music fan in 2021



We are fortunate enough to live in a time where we can listen to an abundance of music and pay very little for all of it, but don’t you wonder how your favourite artists get by in this model?

Streaming their songs alone won’t put bread on their table, but fortunately there are plenty of other ways to support them and in turn, feel a stronger, more direct relationship with them.

Subscribe to their email list
-----------------------------

Did you know that following your favourite musicians on social media and music platforms doesn’t guarantee you’ll see all their content?

This is why you should join their mailing lists.

Usually you can just pop over to their website and join from there.

Buy their merchandise
---------------------

And buy it from them directly.

Again, pop over to their website where they should have some sort of online shop where you can by their branded bits.

Share their website
-------------------

For the above reasons and more, promoting the artist’s website is one of the best things you can do for them, as it’s where they can foster a direct relationship with their fans.
