# MLC vs Harry Fox — What’s the difference?



So you’ve heard of [The Harry Fox Agency](https://www.harryfox.com/), and more recently [The Mechanical Licensing Collective](https://www.themlc.com/) (MLC).

But understandably you’re confused as to who does what.

So here it goes…

What is the MLC and why does it exist?
--------------------------------------

Put simply, the MLC’s job is to collect royalties for songwriters and publishers from DSPs such as Spotify.

This emerged from the signing of the [Music Modernization Act](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress).

What about The Harry Fox Agency?
--------------------------------

HFA contributed to the forming of the MLC’s database.

They used to be responsible for collecting mechanicals from DSPs, but now that role has been [passed onto The MLC.](https://aristake.com/songwriters-claim-mlc-money)

So where do I collect from?
---------------------------

If you are a songwriter, and you don’t have a publishing deal, then the simplest solution is to use a [pub admin service](https://unlockyoursound.com/publishing-admin/) to make sure you’re collecting your mechanicals.
