# Bandcamp updates search function



In an email to users, [Epic-owned Bandcamp](https://unlockyoursound.com/bandcamp-joins-epic-games/) launches its new search functionality.

***“Good news, we’ve made some big improvements to searching on Bandcamp.”***

The email goes on to list some specific improvements:

***“You can now search using combinations of artist, track, album, and label names. Try searching for an artist name + album name to find exactly what you’re looking for.”***

***“New releases used to take several hours to show up in search. Now they appear immediately.”***

***“These changes are already live on the web, and you’ll find them in the Android and iOS apps soon.”***
