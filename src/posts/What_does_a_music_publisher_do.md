# What does a music publisher do?



A music publisher is simply in the business of [handling and exploiting musical compositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_publisher) (aka musical works/songs).

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Collecting [royalties](https://unlockyoursound.com/music-royalties/)
* Securing [sync opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_rights)
* Setting up co-writes

And generally sourcing opportunities for the songwriters they represent.

How is this different to a record company?
------------------------------------------

[Record companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label) deal with sound recordings OF music works, not the musical works themselves.

Do you need a publisher?
------------------------

It depends.

At the very least, if you are a songwriter, you need to make sure you are collecting all the publishing you are owed.

If you havenâ€™t been approached by a publisher, you can use a [publishing admin service](https://unlockyoursound.com/publishing-admin/) to handle that side of the business for you.
