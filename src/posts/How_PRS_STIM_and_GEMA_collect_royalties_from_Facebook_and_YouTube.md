# How PRS, STIM, and GEMA collect royalties from Facebook and YouTube



***Did you know that the aforementioned entities teamed up to collect royalties from digital service providers?***

That group is called ICE.

Itâ€™s via this organisation that the three [PROs](https://unlockyoursound.com/music-royalties/#performance-royalties) licence music to DSPs such as [Facebook](https://help.prsformusic.com/s/article/what-rights-are-covered-by-the-facebook-licence), [YouTube](https://help.prsformusic.com/s/article/what-rights-are-covered-by-the-youtube-licence), [TikTok](https://www.prsformusic.com/press/2020/ice-and-tiktok-agree-to-a-multi-territory-licensing-deal), and others.

This allows the digital service provider to buy a single blanket license for multiple territories. This is branded as the [ICE Core Licence](https://www.iceservices.com/services/licensing/core-licence/).

[ICE was founded in 2010](https://www.iceservices.com/company/about/) as a joint venture between [PRS](https://www.prsformusic.com/what-we-do) of the UK, [STIM](https://www.stim.se/en/this-is-stim) of Sweden, and [GEMA](https://www.gema.de/en/about-gema/) of Germany.

Via its [new Licencr service](https://www.iceservices.com/licensr/), ICE aims to make it easier for smaller music services to use the work of composers and songwriters across the UK, Germany, and Sweden.
