# Minutes to Midnight releases new music video, Skinny Kid



Premiered on [The Indie Buddie](https://www.indiebuddie.com/minutes-to-midnight-skinny-kid-video-premiere/)

> **‘Skinny Kid’**is a tender delicate number as Simone expresses emotional and harrowing themes through a bitter, icy piano and tense progressive soundscapes. With a steady beat pounding through weaving guitars and ominous rumble on bass, the track projects images of isolation and loneliness by means of sinister chilling twinkles and tender vocals. The haunting backing vocals and lamenting pines on guitar have a chilling element as Simone portrays this harsh experience with sublime instrumentation and vivid musicianship.

Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it’s time to tell the tale of how a young man managed to escape Germany in 1945, while his grandson made the other way round in 1991, looking for answers that he could only find in 2017.

After a long stint as an audio professional in the gaming industry, Simone (Minutes to Midnight) has now turned his focus into music production. M2M has decided to tell a very personal story of his in the medium of a concept album.

“After 1989 – A Trip To Freedom” is the debut solo album. A thoroughly crafted concept, it’s the result of a personal journey through a painful family legacy during World War II, and the tumultuous decades that followed.

After 1989 is available on all platforms November 9th. [Pre-save/order today.](https://ffm.to/after1989.opr)
