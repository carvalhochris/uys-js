# What is a publishing admin company and do you need one?



In contrast to a traditional publishing company, a [pub admin](https://help.songtrust.com/knowledge/what-is-a-music-publishing-administrator) manages your musical works for you without you giving over control.

Theyâ€™re typically more flexible than [traditional deals](https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/the_pros_cons_of_signing_a_publishing_deal) and allow you to retain ownership of your songs.

If you write and distribute your own music, then using a pub admin in tandem with your [choice of distributor](https://pirate.com/en/blog/best-music-distribution-services/) will allow you to collect royalties on [both sides of the pie](https://unlockyoursound.com/music-royalties/).

Do you need one?
----------------

Unless you have a publishing deal and/or completely confident that you are collecting all your royalties, then a publishing administrator can give you the peace of mind that your compositions are being properly handled.

Reputable publishing admin companies include [Songtrust](https://www.songtrust.com/), [Sentric](https://sentricmusic.com/), [CDBaby](https://cdbaby.com/), and [Tunecore](https://www.tunecore.co.uk/).

As always, read the fine print and do due dilligence.

Happy publishing!
