# The benefit of getting music reviews in 2022



You might be wondering…

***Do people even read music blogs anymore?***

***Do people even read magazines anymore?***

But that’s not the point of getting your music reviewed in this day and age.

First of all, some people still read blogs and magazines, but it’s not a primary engine for music discovery like it used to be.

Spotify, playlists, algorithms, and social media made sure of that.

However, getting a good write up for your music still has benefits. Especially if you have never had one before.

One benefit of a well-written review for your music video, single, or album is SEO.

If different websites have written about you and your music, then that makes a good impression when someone Google’s your artist name.

Another benefit is that the reviews can be repurposed into your marketing content. You can pull quotes into social media shoutouts and add them to your press kit.

Don’t expect a review to blow up your fan base, even from a top tier mag. But it can help you build your story to show up to your existing followers.
