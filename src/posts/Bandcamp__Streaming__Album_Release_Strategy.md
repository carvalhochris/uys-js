# Bandcamp + Streaming — Album Release Strategy



This strategy is designed for indies releasing an album on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) and streaming platforms.

This is a fan-first approach that rewards your most active fans.

The idea is to use your Bandcamp profile as a landing page for your campaign, allowing you to deliver to real music fans first, collect emails, and foster a community.

Here are the steps:

Set up Bandcamp page
--------------------

And make it look on-point.

Get a good bio going, upload some high-quality photography, and showcase your brand to its fullest extent.

[Here’s a guide](https://unlockyoursound.com/format-bandcamp-page/) on how to do that.

Set up Pre-order
----------------

You can create an album pre-order in Bandcamp. Here’s a [guide](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007902473-How-do-I-set-up-a-pre-order-) on how to do that.

I recommend also that you add some bonus material to the Bandcamp release to incentivise people to buy there first.

Set up Distribution
-------------------

Set it up so that the release goes out to streaming platforms the week AFTER it goes out on Bandcamp.

Use a call-to-action
--------------------

At every step along the way.

Here are some examples:

*Don’t miss a beat — Follow me on Bandcamp*

*Debut album coming soon — Join my mailing list*

*Pre-order on Bandcamp and get exclusive bonus tracks unavailable anywhere else!*

*Buy my new album on Bandcamp — including PDF liner notes and other exclusive goodies!*

*New album coming soon — Brand new merch available on Bandcamp!*

Foster community
----------------

In the week between releases, use the [Bandcamp Community Page](https://www.mrstej.co.uk/the-bandcamp-dashboard-community-tab/) to keep your fans updated.

Then when the streaming release day comes, you can announce it there and to the wider community.

Going beyond…
-------------

This strategy is designed to give you a working model that delivers to your most loyal fans first.

The idea is to use Bandcamp as a [middle-of-funnel](https://unlockyoursound.com/marketing-funnels/) storefront to deliver your complete offering and have a *direct line* with your audience.

From here, you can pull your fans from Bandcamp into your favourite [email marketing software](https://unlockyoursound.com/email-marketing-music/) and further nurture your fan base.
