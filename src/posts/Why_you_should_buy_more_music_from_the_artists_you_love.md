# Why you should buy more music from the artists you love



And why you should buy it ***directly*** from them.

> Fans have paid artists **$597 million** using Bandcamp, and **$17.5 million** in the last 30 days alone.

It helps the artist make more music
-----------------------------------

When you buy their music, they get paid

When they get paid, they get more time to make more music. It’s economics.

When you stream their music, they don’t…really

Of course they get paid, but it’s literally penny fractions per stream after everyone else has been paid. Artists get paid last, and thus least.

You’re not renting
------------------

You might think you’re supporting them by steaming them on Spotify, but you’re doing Daniel Ek more favours than the artist.

When you buy music, you’re sending them actual cash money as opposed to hoping Spotify’s maths work out for them.

It connects you with the artist
-------------------------------

When you buy directly, via their [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) page or their own website, they know you did and it opens a line of communication between you and them.

They can keep you posted on what they’re doing and offer you even more art.

You’re contributing to a fairer music ecocomy
---------------------------------------------

Cut out the middlemen.

Gigs are out…for now
--------------------

And to be fair, it was never even that lucrative for the far majority of artists, after you have factored in all costs.

It’s your shortlist
-------------------

When you buy, you’re more invested in them. The psychology is different. When I buy music on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/christophercarvalho), it’s permanently in [my collection](https://bandcamp.com/christophercarvalho).

It’s good karma
---------------

We gotta sleep, right? Sleep is good. Better karma, better sleep.

Night
