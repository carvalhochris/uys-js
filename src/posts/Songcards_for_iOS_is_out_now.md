Songcards

**What is a songcard?**
-----------------------

A songcard is a digital music collectable that’s composed of a song and a piece of artwork.

When you own a songcard, you have a connection between you and the artist that you don’t get on streaming platforms.

Not only that, but collecting songcards demonstrates that you are a true fan of that artist. And when that artist blows up, you have proof you believed in them before everyone else did.

We call this Proof Of Fan.

**Proof Of Fan**
----------------

As you build your songcard collection, you become a curator of music and get to show off your taste. You can do this by posting and sharing your collector’s page on social media.

Not only does this prove that you discover emerging talent first, but it’s also a great way to promote the artists you love.

The Songcards app is your musical passport as a collector. In the future, this app will be your ticket to experiences offered by the artists you collect from.
