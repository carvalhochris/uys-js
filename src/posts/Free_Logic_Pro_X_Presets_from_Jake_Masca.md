# Free Logic Pro X Presets from Jake Masca



Free Logic Pro X Presets From Jake Masca
----------------------------------------

My friend Jake Masca has just released a bunch of channel strip presets he created from scratch using Logic Pro X.

Check out the video below where he demos the presets and shows you where you can get them.

Be sure also to subscribe to Jake’s [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ScammaD). Jake frequently does live sketching broadcasts where you can sit back and take notes from his production process. Jake’s channel also features some great tutorials for all you Logic Pro X users. Definitely sub-worthy.

Additionally, if you are unsure as to how to install them, I created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Znx-vG7x0o&t=45s) which you can find below Jake’s which will guide you through.
