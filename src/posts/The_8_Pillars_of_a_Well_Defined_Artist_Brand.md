# The 8 Pillars of a Well Defined Artist Brand



When people talk about music marketing and promotion, they talk endlessly of social media tactics, triggering the algorithm, and hacks galore.

But none of that works if you don’t have a well-defined brand and overall strategy for the success of your artistry.

When I work with artists, these are the main pillars we work on.

Until these are defined, everything else can wait.

Under every pillar are a set of key points and questions you need to ask yourself along the way.

The Brand
---------

* What defines the artist?
* What does it look like?
* Is it consistent with the music?

The Story
---------

* How did you get here?
* Why do you do it?
* What will fans say to their friends when talking about you?
* What values are you trying to project into the world?
* What do you care about the most?
* What are your principles?

The Audience
------------

* What do they look like?
* Where do they hang out online/offline?
* What resonates with them?
* What are their values?
* What keeps them up at night?

The Content
-----------

* What content can you put out that will attract your ideal audience?
* Where can you distribute your content to reach your fans?
* What [content model](https://unlockyoursound.com/content-marketing/) can you create that will allow you to consistently deliver value to your followers?
* What’s the call-to-action?

The Funnel

Once you have defined all of the above, you’re on your way to building a lasting brand.

Don’t expect to this to be done in a single session, this is an ongoing pursuit.

Much like your music itself, you are always growing.
