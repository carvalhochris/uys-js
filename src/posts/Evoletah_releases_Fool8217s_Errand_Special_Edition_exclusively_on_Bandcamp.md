[Fool's Errand (Special Edition) by Paper Rock Scissors](https://paperrockscissors.bandcamp.com/album/fools-errand-special-edition)

Matt Cahill is an Australian singer/songwriter & composer. As a graduate of the Ryzard Pusz School of Percussion he has been actively involved with bands since the early eighties, although most notably in his 13 year tenure as ‘Vocalist/Guitarist’ with the multi award winning Australian band ‘The Violets’.

Disillusioned with the traditional ‘band’ format, he eventually formed EVOLETAH, not so much as a band but as a ‘musical project’ to record songs written for The Violets that had never been recorded. Having ‘Cherry Picked’ members, this resulted in the projects initial offering ‘Fool’s Errand’.
