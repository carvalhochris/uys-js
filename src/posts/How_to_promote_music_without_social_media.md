# How to promote music without social media



Social media is awesome, but it also sucks.

It’s transient, noisy, and bad for one’s mental health!

Fortunately, the internet is not limited to social media.

There are plenty of formats where you can promote your music and story without having to do the daily grind on socials.

Email
-----

***Did you know that email marketing is [40x more effective than social media](https://digitalagencynetwork.com/email-marketing-still-effective-strategy/)?***

That’s why [email marketing](https://unlockyoursound.com/email-marketing-music/) is a crucial component of the music marketing mix.

Blogging
--------

Blogging is another great way to tell your story. A blog can be as short or as long as you want.

You can start a blog easily using platforms such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

YouTube
-------

Like making videos? Enter YouTube. YouTube is the second most visited site in the world, second only to its parent Google.

As well as music videos, you can vlog or make any content that might resonate with your audience.

Examples of content you can make on YouTube:

• Livestreams  
• Music videos  
• Lyric videos  
• Video Podcasts  
• Vlogs

Podcasts
--------

Podcasts are a great way of capturing your audience when they’re on a walk or driving to work.

Whether that be your own podcast or guesting on others, it’s another way to tell your story and have people hear your music.

You can start your own very easily, perhaps even interview your artist friends and peers. Promoting others is my favourite way to promote oneself!

Also, did you know that you can use [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/) to distribute your podcast?

PR
--

This is a more traditional route. But fortunately you don’t have to pay an arm and a leg on an expensive publicist. You can use platforms like [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/) or [Musosoup](https://app.musosoup.com/submit/diymusicmakers).
