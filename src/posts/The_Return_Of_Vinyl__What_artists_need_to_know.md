**Guest post by Nicole McCray**

In today’s age, we heavily rely on digital mediums and platforms to create, distribute, and consume art. But in recent years, the demand for vinyl records has increased with more people looking to connect deeper with the music and showcase their taste.

The return of vinyl records is an excellent opportunity for artists to behold and deliver great music for their audience. In this post, we’ll look at a few things artists should know about the return of vinyl.

Vinyl Records Appeal to Millenials
----------------------------------

Vinyl records had for a time been forgotten as more people drifted toward the likes of YouTube, Spotify, and iTunes to listen to their favourite music. In addition, it became easier to access music on your device than going to a physical store to get records.

But now, we see more vinyl sales being recorded, showing that it’s making a remarkable comeback. The [history of vinyl records](https://pirate.com/en/blog/history-of-vinyl/) is fascinating and will continue to evolve into the future.

At first glance, you may think that boomers and Gen X have a nostalgic attachment to records which is why they are investing in them.

However, surveys show that most of the sales are from Millenials with an appreciation for musical art. So, as an artist, you can see a growing trend where your audience would appreciate listening to your music on vinyl records.

Vinyl Creates a Sense of Connection and Closeness
-------------------------------------------------

People are investing in modern and vintage vinyl records to enjoy the connection and closeness of the music. This is because taking the initiative to go out into a store to choose records that suit them is incredibly satisfying.

Music lovers can’t instantly download vinyl records from the cloud. Instead, they walk into a physical store and go through different albums to find what they want. Being in the presence of pure artistry brings a greater sense of appreciation and connection.

In addition, vinyl records come with great covers, some with incredible art that speak volumes about the music album. Seeing and understanding the art on the cover allows people to analyze the artist’s motivations and connect deeper to their music.

Vinyl Changes How We Listen to Music
------------------------------------

The digital age has been a significant game changer in music distribution. Artists benefit significantly from different platforms. We now see people creating content and utilizing other music from various artists.

The monetary benefits from things like [TikTok music copyrights](https://www.trackclub.com/resources/tiktok-copyright-music-what-creators-need-to-know), YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms come in handy for artists. However, the digitization of music completely changed how we listen to it.

We miss the significant bits with the freedom to play, skip, stop, and fast-forward music on digital platforms. Listening to the artist’s words and their message can, at times, be a struggle.

But, with vinyl records, you can listen to a whole album without distractions from other great hits on the recommended pages. These records shift how we listen to music and allow us to stop and enjoy it as an art.

Some people also say they love the imperfections and the superiority of analogue sound, which changes how we perceive music.

Vinyl Acts as a Great Collectible or Heirloom
---------------------------------------------

Having a favourite artist’s album as a vinyl record is a great collectable and heirloom that can be passed down through generations. People can also share it with friends and enjoy a common interest that brings them together.

The best part is the cover art and detailed liner notes. Each vinyl record will have different details, making it unique and pleasing. When stored, these vinyl records can be aesthetically pleasing to showcase the art and add an element of detail to the space.

So, as an artist, realising that people will continue to invest in vinyl records to add to their collection gives you a great advantage.

Vinyl Allows Listeners to Invest in Their Favorite Artists
----------------------------------------------------------

Music lovers are ever so eager to support artists to show their appreciation for the incredible masterpieces they produce. So what better way to do that than to invest in physical copies of their works that may be slightly highly-priced?

Vinyl records allow listeners to invest in their favourite artists to encourage them to keep the albums coming. These records are more pricey than streaming music on other digital platforms.

In addition, the [profits and music royalties](https://unlockyoursound.com/music-royalties/) of streaming and music records can differ significantly. Streaming platforms may pay a fraction for downloads and listens, while vinyl records allow you to keep more profit with the sale.
